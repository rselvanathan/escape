NOTE - The Executable file is/will be placed inside VC10/Escape/BIN/ - Due to technical problems the Executable is only runnable 

when inside the "Escape" folder so I decided to keep it there. (did not have enough time to figure out why I cant keep it outside 

with the other folders here)

NOTE - The source code is inside the SRC folder right here.
