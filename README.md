A 3D game developed in 28 days as part of my final year in university. The insutruction given to me was to build any game with the theme 
and tile 'Escape', which gave me the creative freedom to develop what I wanted. This project was my first 3D demo and it requires 
the player to escape the world by solving simple 2 puzzles. 

The engine and the game code were developed from scratch only using C++ and OpenGL.

Key Features
- Physics (Kinematics, Elastic Collisions, Friction, Gravity) 
- Collision Detection 
- State - Based AI 
- Dynamic Camera System
- Billboard Particle Effects 
- Orthographic HUD display

Notes & Instructions

https://www.dropbox.com/s/96kmympiyct45af/Escape_EXECUTABLE.zip

The above executable will contain a standalone executable with the required assets, that can be run on any machine 
that has OpenGL installed and windows running. The executable may ask for the "Windows Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package" 
if it has never been installed before, which is necessary to run any C++ executable built using the VS2010 IDE. The download will come 
with the installation file (if the file does not work you can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555) 

To view the source code it is suggested to use the VS2010 IDE (which will break the code down in categories/folers", however you can use 
a standard "notepad" like software. The source code download will contain further notes and instructions to help navigate through the 
folders.

To view the source code, with intended group/folder seperations please open the "VS10/Escape/Escape.sln" file. 
This will open both the engine and the game source files viewable on Visual Studio.
